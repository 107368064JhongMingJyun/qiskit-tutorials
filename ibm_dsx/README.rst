Using IBM DSx for your notebooks
--------------------------------

`IBM Data Science Experience <https://datascience.ibm.com>`__ (DSx) is a
platform where you can interactively run your quantum programs,
collaborate and share your work with others.

Among other things, it provides a ready-to-use environment to run
Jupyter Python notebooks. For someone just getting started with QISkit,
this is an excellent option. You can skip all the installation and
environment creation steps on your computer, and instead use this
web-hosted Jupyter notebook environment for running the Quantum
programs. It also provides a platform where you can invite fellow
researchers to collaborate on the notebooks you have developed or simply
share your work within the community.
